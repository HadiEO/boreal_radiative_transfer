# Radiative transfer modelling of forest reflectance using PARAS, and global sensitivity analysis.

This is the full code repository used for analysis in the paper "Hadi, M. Rautiainen. 2018. A study on the drivers of canopy reflectance variability in a boreal forest. 
Remote Sensing Letters 9 (7), 666-675" available open access at https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/2150704X.2018.1458344 . The codes are in the process of being cleaned, re-structured, and better documented.
